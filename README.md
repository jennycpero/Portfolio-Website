# Portfolio-Website
This is the code for my portfolio website, a simple static website intended to advertise myself and my skills to employers. This website is hosted through InfinityFree using the Filezilla FTP application.
To view the website for yourself, jennycpero.rf.gd is the URL.

Though a JS file is shown, it is currently empty. At this time, my website is only using HTML and CSS.
