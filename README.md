# Portfolio-Website
This is the code for my portfolio website, a simple static website intended to advertise myself and my skills to employers. This website is hosted through InfinityFree using the Filezilla FTP application.
To view the website for yourself, jennycpero.rf.gd is the URL.

I uploaded this repository later than I had intended, so the first branch of this website that I will be publishing will actually be the version that I have labelled as "1.3" for my website, and not 1.1 or 1.2.

Though a JS file is shown, it is currently empty. At this time, my website is only using HTML and CSS.
