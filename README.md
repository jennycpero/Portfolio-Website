# Portfolio-Website
This is the code for my portfolio website, a simple static website intended to advertise myself and my skills to employers. This website is hosted through InfinityFree using the Filezilla FTP application.
To view the website for yourself, jennycpero.rf.gd is the URL.

I uploaded this repository later than I had intended, so my default branch will actually be version 1.3. However, branches 1.1 and 1.2 are still avaliable.

Though a JS file is shown, it is currently empty. At this time, my website is only using HTML and CSS.
